    <p>
        This project is a real-time pneumonia detection system that uses deep learning on chest X-ray images.
        The model predicts whether the X-ray shows a healthy lung or signs of pneumonia.
    </p>
    <p>
        Features include:
        <ul>
            <li>Accurate detection using a CNN-based model (VGG16 or similar)</li>
            <li>Interactive web interface for uploading X-ray images</li>
            <li>Model evaluation metrics and confusion matrix visualization</li>
            <li>Clinical recommendations based on results</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
